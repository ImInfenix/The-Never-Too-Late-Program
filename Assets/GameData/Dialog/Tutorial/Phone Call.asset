  - Yeah that's it ! Now it's time to get to work !
  - Each day start at 09:00 and ends at 17:00. As we always need to have more products,
    if you reach your goal before 15:00, you will have a little extra work.
  - This is how The Never Too Late Program works, wonderful isn't it ?
  - You can see your goal on the top left and the time on the top right of your screen.
  - I will probably call you during the day. It is ALWAYS important so you have to
    answer. If you don't you will have more work to do !
  - Pick up the objects and bring them to the conveyor belt ! Don't forget you can
    carry more than one at a time !
